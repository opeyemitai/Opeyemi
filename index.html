										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/mr funny.webp" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The Influence of Ads Initiative:
											
											Businesses have been quick to recognize the potential of skit makers as a novel and effective means of promoting their products and services on Instagram. This has led to a surge in interest from businesses seeking to collaborate with skit makers to create entertaining and engaging content that appeals to a wide range of viewers.
											
											In response to this growing demand, many skit makers have launched business ad initiatives on their pages, offering businesses the opportunity to advertise their products or services for a fee.
											
											This has proven to be an incredibly successful approach, as evidenced by the high number of businesses that have taken advantage of this opportunity on Sabinus' page. This was evident when the popular skit maker Sabinus with a follower of 3.8M declared his intention to advertise several businesses on his page on the 3rd of May,2023 for a fee of N50,000 each, within a 24-hour window.
											
											Data collection from 37 businesses on May 4th, 2023 as of 2:30 am shows that :
											
											Sabinus made a total of 1.85M from the ad post and the advert charges ranged from N150,000 to N250,000 across the business sector advertised on his platform.
											
											Total engagements of the business ad posted, include a total of 558k Likes, and 14k comments.
											
											An array of businesses were advertised such as fashion, Body Beauty, Real Estate, Catering, Entertainment, etc.
											
											By collaborating with skit makers in this way, businesses can tap into a new and engaged audience, reach a wider range of potential customers, and ultimately grow their business. This approach also allows businesses to create more personalized and engaging content, which can help to build brand loyalty and increase customer engagement.
											
											Overall, the business ads initiative has proven to be a valuable tool for businesses seeking to expand their reach and connect with new audiences on Instagram.
